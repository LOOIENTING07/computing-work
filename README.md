This follows Waiting For The Crow To Come
I like writing (sad) bird poems

Sparrow on a willow tree

Sparrow on a wilow tree,
Free and happy as can be

Perching on the little branch,
The tiny bird chirped and pranced

In the damp streets a cold wind blowed
Bringing near the first traces of snow

The sparrow shivered and its claws got weak
The once blue sky now looking bleak

Soon darkness fell and draped the land
In a shroud of malice, evil and grand

Shadows imposing and twisting up from the ground
The lightposts blowing out ; all warmth was down

The sparrow was alone and cold in the void
Blind in the gloom and doom of happiness destroyed

Suddenly a lone figure stood on the pavement, looking shrewd
Below a lampost it stood shivering, too cold to find food
